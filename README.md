# Recursion

This repo contains two exercises solved in JavaScript to learn about recursion.
The first exercise requires to calculate a certain amount of numbers in the
fibonacci sequence. The second exercise requires to write a merge sort
algorithm.

## Fibonacci

The fibonacci sequence is a numerical sequence where each number is the sum of
the two numbers before it.

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...`

## Merge sort

Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that can be used to sort the items of an array
from smallest to largest. It does so by recursively splitting the array into two
halves, sorting each half and merging them back together. It is limited by the
fact that arrays of length 0 and 1 are already sorted.
